# CS-300_Analysis_and_Design

In this course we used data structures to learn about associated mechanisms for dealing with data and processes. Specifically we delved into code which implemented various methods for storing and retrieving data. We were faced with the problem of finding the best solution for handling course information and prerequisites. I decided the binary tree was the best structure to use based on speed and predictability.
